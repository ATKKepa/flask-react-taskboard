# TaskOn

TaskOn is a full-stack productivity workspace that pairs a Flask API with a React + Mantine UI frontend. Organize tasks in draggable boards, keep quick notes, and stash project assets in the built-in file gallery, all backed by a lightweight SQLite database.

> 💡 **Why it matters:** I built TaskOn to demonstrate end-to-end product thinking, real-time drag-and-drop UX, resilient persistence layers, and a polished developer experience. The result is a project that’s ready to deploy and easy to extend.

## Recruiter-Friendly Highlights

- **Production-grade UX:** Responsive Mantine UI, smooth dnd-kit workflows, empty states, optimistic updates, and accessible interactions.
- **Robust backend:** Flask service with migration safety net, idempotent file handling, checksum de-duplication, and optimized SQL queries.
- **Clean architecture:** Shared contracts via `api.ts`, typed React components, and separation between board logic, notepad features, and gallery uploads.
- **Deployment ready:** Environment-driven config, SQLite migrations, and a README that documents setup, API, and deployment strategy.
- **Extensible roadmap:** Hooks for multi-user support, real-time notifications (Pusher/WebSockets), granular permissions, and tagging/filters.

## Features

- **Boards & Todos** – Create multiple lists with custom colors, add tasks, edit titles inline, and delete items or entire lists.
- **Drag-and-Drop** – Reorder tasks within a list or move them across lists using dnd-kit with smooth auto-scroll support.
- **Notepad** – Quick jot area for lightweight todos that can be promoted into boards later.
- **File Gallery** – Upload, preview, download, and delete reference files (PDF, PNG/JPG, DOCX/XLSX/PPTX, ZIP/RAR, and more).
- **Statistics** – Summary card highlighting the total number of tracked tasks at a glance.
- **Auto Seeding & Migrations** – On startup the API creates default lists, applies schema migrations, and backfills positions to keep data consistent.

## Tech Stack

| Layer        | Tech                                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend     | React, Vite, TypeScript, Mantine UI, dnd-kit              |
| Backend      | Flask, Werkzeug, SQLite                                   |
| Styling      | Mantine theming + custom components                       |
| Tooling      | Vite dev server/build, npm (or pnpm), Python virtualenv   |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (npm or pnpm)
- (Recommended) `virtualenv` or `venv` for Python

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app app run --debug
```

The API listens on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default. It creates `todo.db` and runs migrations automatically on first launch.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install          # or pnpm install
npm run dev
```

Open the Vite dev server (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5173`). API requests are proxied to the Flask backend, update `vite.config.ts` if your backend runs elsewhere.

## API Highlights

All endpoints are served under `/api`.

## Development Notes

- Drag-and-drop behavior lives in `client/src/components/WorkspaceDnD.tsx`.
- File type allowlists (extensions and MIME types) are defined near the top of `server/app.py`.
- The backend runs lightweight migrations and data backfills on every request via `init_db()` and `backfill_data()`.
- Summary statistics and UI widgets reside in `client/src/components/SummaryCard.tsx` and related components.

## Testing & Quality

Add your preferred tooling, for example:

```bash
# Frontend linting (configure ESLint)
npm run lint

# Backend tests (add pytest and tests/)
pytest
```

## Deployment Checklist

1. Build the frontend: `cd client && npm run build`.
2. Serve the compiled assets (e.g., via Vite preview, Nginx, or Flask static hosting).
3. Run the Flask app behind a production WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI) and reverse proxy.
4. Configure environment variables (`FLASK_ENV`, upload paths, secrets, etc.).
5. Set up persistent storage for `todo.db` and `uploaded_files/uploads`.

## CI/CD Automation

- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push, pull request, or manual dispatch and cancels superseded runs per branch.
- Frontend job (Node 20): `npm ci`, lint with zero tolerated warnings, `npm run build`, then uploads the `client/dist` artifact for download from the Actions run.
- Backend job (Python 3.11): installs `server/requirements.txt`, compiles all Python sources to catch syntax errors early, and imports the Flask app to verify dependencies.
- Dependency caching is enabled for npm and pip based on `client/package-lock.json` and `server/requirements.txt` to keep runs fast.
- Run the same checks locally: `cd client && npm ci && npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0 && npm run build`, plus `python -m pip install -r server/requirements.txt` and `python -m compileall server`.
